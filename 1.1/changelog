Complex Number Calculation Library 1.1 - Aug 15, 2013 21:44

- decimals!
- fixed bug: resetting variables now works
- all errors are now sent to error function and logged before they are thrown
- added a quote of the error causing object to each error message
- errors coming from prec-math are now caught and logged as well
- fixed bug: numToDisp works when re = 0 now
- all errors in error function instead of in parse and calc
- error function parses error string and separates the name from the data and logs it accordingly
- removed getLog and logfile array (no use; use callback function)
- evalLisp now logs on finish the before and after
