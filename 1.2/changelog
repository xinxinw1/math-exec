Complex Number Calculation Library 1.2 - Aug 19, 2013 16:02

- moved variable handling to processVariables function
- added variable and equation objects
- when function has no arguments, array now has only one element (func name) just like lisp
- added comments for every object type in getObject
- fixed bug: 2^2^3 now correctly interprets as 2^(2^3) instead of (2^2)^3
- evalLisp("") now returns "" instead of undefined
- new getVariable and unsetVariable functions
- fixed bug: setVariable no longer push a new entry into variables array if name is already found
- fixed bug: numToDisp("") now correctly returns ""
- notice: because of variable processing change, the data in the variables array are now lisp arrays instead of math exprs
